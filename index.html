     <h1>Star Miscanthus' Craved Words!!</h1>
    <h3 style="color: black;">
        Brother Hua, will join the second stage?!
    </h3>
    <p> The Registration Point was filled with many people. The queue was very long and there were many surrounding cultivators trying to look for a group.

        Hua Wu Que thought for awhile and decided not to cut the queue. After all, he felt that he was a civilized and well-mannered individual. And so, he willingly joined the back of the queue.
        
        Although there were many people in the queue, most of them were already in groups of six. Upon getting their wooden tablets, they left the queue in a hurry.
        
        Before long, Hua Wu Que had reached the front of the queue.
        
        At this point, a few tall and sturdy figures abruptly appeared right beside Hua Wu Que. </p>
    <h3>Am I a problem's magnet? </h3>    
    <p>Before Hua Wu Que could say anything, he heard a low pitched voice , "Lad, if you are smart, you will move away. If not, when we enter the mountain valley to find the medicine, I will make you suffer."

        "Idiot, get lost!" Hua Wu Que replied.
        
        He glanced at the few of them and was too lazy to reason with them any further.
        
        The opposition were around level 8 or 9 of the Golden Core Stage. Although there were six of them, Hua Wu Que could crush them with his finger if he wanted to.
        
        After hearing Hua Wu Que’s reply, the six of them became furious. One of the burly men reprimanded, "I dare you to say it one more time!"
        
        Oh yeah!
        
        Hua Wu Que was overjoyed. He actually managed to find someone who enjoyed being scolded? Alright, I shall oblige you.
        
        "May your mum explode to death, your father is already dead. Get out of my way!" He rapidly let out a chain of insults.
        
        "You shameful being, you’re itching to die!" The burly man refuted furiously, raised his fist and was about to fight.</p>
    <h3>The King Of Porcelain Touching World</h3>
    <p>However, he was held back by his group.

        Many surrounding cultivators started to crowd around. Some were curious, some were here to witness others’ misfortune and some were here to join in the fun.
        
        At the same time, a green-robed Original Infant Stage disciple hurriedly walked over and frowned, "No one is allowed to make a racket in this area. This is a warning. If there is a next time, all of you shall be disqualified."
        
        After that, he fiercely stared at the burly man and Hua Wu Que before slowly turning to leave.
        
        The burly man stared coldly at Hua Wu Que and revealed an eerie smile, "Lad, you are done! When we enter the mountain valley, no one will be able to protect you." Finishing his words, he ended by tauntingly patting Hua Wu Que’s shoulder, and left.
        
        "Argh!" Suddenly, Hua Wu Que let out a piercing scream.
        
        Under the eyes of everyone, like a kite with a broken string, Hua Wu Que abruptly flew backwards and landed on an empty space. His palms were tightly gripped around his shoulders, which the burly man tapped. His face was pale and filled with various expressions of agony, grievance, anger, unwillingness, and… most of it was just grievance!
        
        "Whoosh!" In a flash, the Original Infant stage disciple in green robes returned and appeared between Hua Wu Que and the burly man. His face was utterly displeased and he asked in a deep voice, "What happened?"
        
        Hua Wu Que who was lying on the ground, raised his arm with "extreme difficulty", and shakingly pointed at the burly man with a dying expression. He angrily exclaimed, "This… this man is vicious. I didn’t let him cut the queue and… and I didn’t think that he would… mount a surprise attack on me!"
